**D. Key Findings & Actionable Plans**

**Key Findings**
- CTR & Bounce Rate are the strongest predictors	High Click-Through Rate and low Bounce Rate significantly increase conversion probability.
- Longer session durations correlate with higher conversions	Users who spend more time are more likely to complete a purchase.
- Pages viewed is the least influential	Contrary to expectations, more page views doesn‚Äôt guarantee conversion if the session lacks engagement.

**Actionable Plans**
- Increase CTR by optimizing product recommendations and ad placements.
- Reduce Bounce Rate through better landing page design and faster load times.
- Track session intent ‚Äì not just duration, but meaningful engagement (e.g., add-to-cart).
